"""Print over Bluetooth: the transport details every client shares.

The T003 is dual-mode and takes the same TSPL (protocol.py) over both transports:

- Classic serial (RFCOMM), used by the desktop app and CLI through `send` below. Linux only so far: it needs Python's
  Bluetooth sockets, which Linux has, macOS lacks and Windows may have (untested).
- BLE (GATT), used by the web build from a browser (Web Bluetooth). Its UUIDs and timings are in `BLE` so the web
  client reads them from `api.options()` instead of repeating them; nothing in Python opens a BLE connection.

No Qt and no USB in here. Pairing is not needed (RFCOMM connects to an unpaired printer, verified on Linux); the
printer only has to be switched on, in range and not held by a phone.
